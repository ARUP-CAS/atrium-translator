"""processors/limit_notes.py — where a limit that shaped a result writes its note (#53).

``atrium_limits.LimitNotes`` records every limit that shaped a translation without refusing
it (``limits_applied`` in the paradata and in the service response). The notes are made
deep inside the processors and the backends — where a segment is sampled for language
identification, split into chunks, or given up on — and the backends are ONE shared
object per process, so the notes cannot live on them.

``main.process_single_file`` therefore opens a collector for the file it processes
(:func:`collecting`) and the code below it adds to it with :func:`note`. The collector is
thread-local, which is sound here and only here because ``process_single_file`` is
synchronous and single-threaded: the batch CLI calls it in a loop, and the service runs
each call in ONE worker thread (``asyncio.to_thread``), and nothing inside it starts a
thread. Outside a collector, :func:`note` does nothing, so a unit test or a direct call
of a backend needs no setup.
