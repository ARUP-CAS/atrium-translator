"""
service/api.py

FastAPI service for the ATRIUM LINDAT Translator.
Brings this repository into API parity with the rest of the ATRIUM pipeline.

The typed contract (atrium-project#32 round 2). Every route declares its response model
and its error statuses, so the committed ``service/openapi.json`` — attached to every
release, and what the AMČR pipeline generates its clients from — types every field.
``/translate`` answers the translated XML (or multipart/mixed with the record) as before;
``response_format=json`` asks for one JSON object instead (``TranslateResponse``), the
shape a generated client reads without a multipart parser. Both of those carry the run's
Process Run Crate ``CreateAction`` (atrium-project#71); a bare XML answer has no place for it. The models below DOCUMENT the
responses (``response_model=None``), and ``tests/test_api_contract.py`` validates real
responses against the published schema. Refusals carry registered reasons: an upload that
is not ``.xml`` is 415 ``unsupported_media_type``, a record that cannot be opened is 422
``invalid_record``. Regenerate the spec after an API change::
