tests/test_http_retry.py – Unit tests for processors/http_retry.py, the shared
bounded-exponential-backoff helper used by both translation backends.

``time.sleep`` is patched out so the retry loop runs instantly; the transport is
faked with a zero-arg ``perform`` callable, mirroring the module's design.

# ── Retry policy is configuration, not a suggestion (atrium-project#53, factor III) ──
#
# request_with_retry used to clamp its own arguments upward:
#
#     max_retries = max(10, max_retries)
#     backoff_base_s = max(2, backoff_base_s)
#
# so LINDAT_MAX_RETRIES / LINDAT_BACKOFF_BASE_S / LLM_MAX_RETRIES /
# LLM_BACKOFF_BASE_S were read from the environment and then discarded for every
# value below the floor -- while .env.example and service/README.md documented
# them as working knobs. The effective policy was 11 attempts backing off
# 2*2**attempt, i.e. 2+4+...+1024 = 2046 s of sleep for ONE failing chunk, which
# no /translate request could survive against GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN_S=20 plus
# serve_lifecycle's drain: the container was SIGKILLed mid-retry every time.
#
# The back-off half was invisible: pytest.ini sets LINDAT_BACKOFF_BASE_S=0.0,
# max(2, 0.0) restored 2, and conftest.py patches time.sleep globally, so no test
# could see the sleeps at all. The retry-count half was worse than invisible --
# tests/test_translator.py and tests/test_llm_backend.py had both been updated to
# assert 11 attempts and to call that "10 default retries", while the declared
# default in the code, in .env.example and in service/README.md was 4. The suite
# was green on a policy no caller had asked for, and said so in a comment.
#
# These tests assert the arguments are used AS GIVEN, and they fail loudly if the
# clamp is ever reintroduced.
