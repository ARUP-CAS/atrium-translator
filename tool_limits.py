"""tool_limits.py — every limit atrium-translator has (atrium-project#53, factor III).

One declaration, read by the batch CLI (``main.py``), the processors and the service, and
reported by ``GET /info`` (``limits`` and ``limits_meta``). Each limit is an environment
setting; a malformed value stops the process at startup, naming the variable
(``atrium_limits.LimitConfigError``). ``.env.example`` and ``service/README.md``'s
``## Limits`` table list the same set, and ``tests/test_limits_contract.py`` checks that
they agree. Values are read on every use, so a changed variable takes effect without a
restart of a long-running process and a test can set one.

What happens over each limit — refused, or processed in full with a ``limits_applied``
note — is said beside it. The LLM and CT2 limits apply only when that backend is the one
``TRANSLATION_BACKEND`` selects; they are declared (and reported) regardless, so ``/info``
does not depend on which backend happens to be imported.

Standard library only (``atrium_limits`` is the hub's canonical module at the repo root).
